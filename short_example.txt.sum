Grace Brewster Murray Hopper was an American computer scientist and United States Navy rear admiral. One of the first programmers of the Harvard Mark I computer, she was a pioneer of computer programming who invented one of the first compiler related tools. She popularized the idea of machine-independent programming languages, which led to the development of COBOL, an early high-level programming language still in use today.

Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing is a convention for Women in the field of Computer Science and Technology. Held yearly, this conference is designed to bring the research and career interests of women in computing to the forefront.
